# Face-mask-detection1
Overview

This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. It detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not and provides an alert sound if a mask is not detected.

This system can be useful in public areas to encourage mask-wearing during pandemics or for monitoring safety compliance.

Features

Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.

Predicts mask-wearing status (Mask or No Mask) using a trained CNN model.

Plays an alert sound when a face without a mask is detected.

Lightweight and easy to run.

Requirements

Python 3.10+

TensorFlow

OpenCV

NumPy

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

tensorflow
opencv-python
numpy
playsound

Usage
1. Train the Model

If you want to retrain the model:

python train_mask_detector.py


Make sure the data/ folder contains subfolders:

with_mask/ – images of people wearing masks

without_mask/ – images of people without masks

The trained model will be saved as mask_detector.h5.

2. Run Real-Time Detection
python detect_mask_live.py


A webcam window will open.

Faces will be detected and labeled as Mask or No Mask.

Plays alert.mp3 if a face without a mask is detected.

Press q to quit.

Notes

Ensure mask_detector.h5 and alert.mp3 are in the same folder as the detection script.

The model input size is 150x150 pixels, so resizing is handled in the script.

The project uses Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and CNN for mask classification.
